## üíº Projects

### [Robust Text Summarization on SAMSum and XSum](https://github.com/kenton-tang-kl/Exploring-the-Robustness-of-Dialogue-Based-Summarization/tree/main)
PyTorch, Hugging Face*
- Conducted a comprehensive project evaluating the robustness and cross-domain generalization capabilities of
DistilBART-cnn-12-6 for abstractive text summarization, leveraging SAMSum (dialogue) and XSum (news) data
- Implemented a fine-tuning strategy on the SAMSum dataset to enhance in-domain performance, followed by
out-of-domain evaluation on the XSum dataset, using metrics such as ROUGE to assess performance
- Applied advanced training techniques such as learning rate scheduling, weight decay adjustments, and early
stopping to optimize the training process, ensuring effective fine-tuning and minimizing the risk of overfitting
- Achieved robust performance in dialogue summarization, with the distilled model attaining a ROUGE-1 score
of 39.89, which aligns with the benchmark performance of the bart-large models, which score around 40.891

### [Facebook Clone](https://github.com/kenton-tang-kl/facebook-clone)
*React.js, Express.js, MongoDB*  
- Architected a full-stack social media platform using the MERN stack.
- Implemented robust user authentication and CRUD operations with image uploads, real-time likes, comments, and deletions.
- Engineered a responsive front-end with a Light/Dark mode toggle, leveraging Redux for state management and Express.js for RESTful API integration.

### [Ultramarathon Data Analysis](https://github.com/kenton-tang-kl/ultramarathon-analysis)
*Numpy, Pandas, Matplotlib, scikit-learn*  
- Conducted a comprehensive analysis of ultramarathon data, focusing on trends such as historical impacts and gender dynamics.
- Developed a predictive model using Random Forest Classifier with an R¬≤ score of 0.689 to forecast ultramarathon finishing times.
